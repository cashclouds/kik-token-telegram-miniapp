# Notes:
# - Put actual contract addresses here after running `npm run post:deploy` (or copy from deployments/amoy-deployment.json).
# - Vercel will automatically build Next.js projects using `npm run build`.
# - If wallet-app reads `wallet-app/lib/contracts.ts`, consider switching it to read these env vars (I can update it for you).
